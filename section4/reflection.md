## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I've been trying to make a habit of using the Pomodoro method since starting Mod 0. I recently extended my work periods to 40 minutes because I have a bad habit of ignoring my break timer if I felt like I was in the flow of things.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

Using this method definitely keeps me more focused than when I wasn't using it. It's a great way to remind me to take breaks too because sometimes I can lose track of time and then I realize I haven't taken a break in hours.

I definitely don't estimate times accurately. Almost every time, tasks that I've set take longer than I originally planned. Not gonna lie, that makes me anxious because I don't feel like I'm underestimating the time when I originally set them. I think it just points to me not asking for help soon enough.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An object is used to represent a "thing" in our code (person, car, building, etc). They are made up of characteristics (or properties) that consist of a key and a value.

An Array is used when we want to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable. They are useful when creating an ordered collection.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class: **Array** - It will create a list of students in one class. No varying types of properties.
  * List of states and their capitals: **Object** - You can make a class of "states" and have the capitals as different instances with properties about each capital.
  * List of things to pack for vacation: **Array** - This will created an ordered list of things to pack.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow: **Array** - This will create an ordered list of what accounts I follow. If I wanted more information about the accounts, I would think an Object would be better.
  * List of student names and their cohort: **Object** - The student names will likely have different properties. Using an object would be better than using an array.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake: **Object** - The ingredients and the amount of each ingredient are different properties that would work best in an Object format.
  * All my favorite restaurants: **Array** - Working with a grouping of information that is all the sam type.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

I use my photos app quite a bit. Some of the keys for the albums could be 'timeStamp' with a value of "12/06/19, 6:15pm" or 'location' with a value of "Cabo".

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

Do the parameters set in the constructor method always have to match the properties? Is there any reason why you wouldn't include properties into your parameters?
