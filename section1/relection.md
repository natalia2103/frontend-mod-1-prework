## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I love the idea that being a Super Learner is something that I can work towards, not something that you're either born with or not. I have the ability to learn and grow, unhindered by what my past learning habits may have been. It's not too late to change them now.  I learned that teaching others what I know solidifies my knowledge about a subject from my time training people at my previous job. I am new to the concept of taking frequent breaks when studying but it's quickly becoming habit through this process. One thing that surprised me was the idea that I need to take care of my brain through what I eat. It makes sense now, but before I read this article it was never something that I considered doing.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
  * **String:** Can hold a value of letters, numbers, and special characters wrapped in either single or double qoutes, the key is to be consistent with which qoutations I use.
  * **Numbers:** Can hold a numeric value. Either whole (35 or -15) or float (35.5) numbers can be used. No qoutations needed.
  * **Boolean:** Can only hold a value of "true" or "false". Variable is usually phrased as a question (isOpen). No qoutations needed for this one either. Booleans can be useful when deciding which code should run.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

         var sentence = "Hello World!"
         console.log(sentence)

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

Code comments are great for making notes in your code to refer back to later. Also great for other developers who look at your code to help them understand what you did. We can also use code comments to deactivate parts of our code that we don't want to run yet. Everything on a single line that follows two backslashes (//) will not run. For multiple line code comments, we can use /* ... */).


5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is like a container that keeps information for us. We can open the container to find what's inside, and even change what's in the container to something else.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I'm on Instagram a lot. A few variables might be:
 var username = (string);
 var password = (string);
 var isLoggedIn = (boolean);
 var numberOfFollowers = (integer);

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

We use concatenation to add together strings and other data types into one output using the (+) operator.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

I think one instance of using concatenation would be if a website or app had a welcome message of some sort. They would already have part of the message ready to go, and would add the information given by that user and use concatenation to put it all together.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

Is it possible to have two different variables with different data types to have the same name? Is there anything set up when writing code to prompt the developer that the variable name has already been used?

I was also wondering about the use of concatenation vs interpolation. I'm sure it will become more clear the more I code, but is there a certain point in longer strings when it's very clear that interpolation should be used over concatenation?
