## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

It's definitely been hard to find a good balance when it comes to asking questions. I fall more towards waiting too long before I ask for help. The blog "Your Questions Are Dumb; Ask Them Anyway" described me perfectly. I can't shake the feeling that if I just google a little longer, I'll find the answer I'm looking for. I don't want to just "give up". I need to work on accepting my dumb question babies. I also need to work on articulating my questions a little better before asking them. I feel like I panic a little when asking questions, and I don't always remember to ask follow up questions to make sure I understand the answer I've been given. I'll need to work on that too.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

It was uncomfortable realizing that I didn't remember exactly how to node the exercises into my command line. But this forced me to go back to section1 to get a refresh on the process, and then I wrote it down in my notes so if I forgot again I had quicker access to the information I needed. Of course, using the command over and over to check my work really helped to solidify the command in my mind.

I think having us learn from outside resources really drives home the point that we need to be googling often to find the answers we're looking for. The information is out there, we just need to practice finding it. I liked that it wasn't all blogs either. It was interspersed with youtube videos and free courses where we can practice.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement tells a program to execute different actions depending on whether the conditions set are true or false.

An example of a daily life conditional would maybe be deciding whether or not to take your umbrella when you leave. You ask yourself conditional statements and make your choices from there. Is it raining? Take your umbrella if true, leave your umbrella if false.

An example of a conditional statement being used in a web application would be if I was trying to buy beer online and I had to input my date of birth. The conditional statement would be set to not let me in if the information I gave for the parameters put my age under 21.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You use 'else if' and 'else' to add multiple conditions to an 'if' statement. The program reads from the top, line by line, until a statement runs true.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

I can use logical operators. These operators put out a single boolean output from multiple boolean expressions. ''&&'' = logical and, '||'' = logical or, and '!' = logical not

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

How many conditions would be considered too many inside of a function? Is there a way to self check to make sure my code stays concise?
