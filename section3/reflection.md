## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I really resonated with the idea of believing that I can improve my coding skills with effort and practice. It's such a basic concept but having this mindset makes me really excited to keep learning and practicing. I see things on web pages and apps now that I can't even wrap my head around how it was built, but instead of feeling discouraged, I get excited for the idea that someday I'll know how to do those things.

I definitely need to work on being comfortable not just asking for help, but also being comfortable making connections within the programming community. The idea of being vulnerable and putting myself out there gives me a little anxiety. It was a lot easier at my last job since it was a customer service job and part of that was making connections with my coworkers and customers in a face-to-face environment.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I didn't know the name for this before I read the blog, but learning within my Zone of Proximal Development is something I do. Especially though this program, every session is building on concepts I've learned from the session before. Each one of these sections builds on my understanding by solidifying what I know while presenting challenges to help me grow. I can see progress in myself which is an awesome feeling.

I have a bad habit of not thinking of mistakes as a critical part of learning. I tend to get down on myself if I make a mistake and let it fester for longer than I should. Another bad habit is that I tend to compare my progress with others. If I see someone learning a concept faster than me, I definitely get a little discouraged and start doubting myself. I understand that this can be very destructive.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

I use Instagram a lot. I see examples of arrays in a lot of different places. Some examples would be a list of followers, a list of people you are following, the posts on a profile, maybe even the instagram stories hold an array of the posts and videos in them.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

Array methods are functions built-in to JavaScript that we can apply to our arrays to change them or perform calculations.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

Loops are used to execute a code block multiple times without having to re-type the direction over and over again. 

We would use a loop in conjunction with an array when we want to run the same instruction for each item in that array.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it

Loops are used to save us time when we need to give the same instructions over and over again. It's like your mom telling you "Set the table for four". Instead of telling you "Set this plate on the table, then set this plate on the table, then set this plate on the table, then set this plate on the table."

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

How are we able to direct exactly where we want to add a new element into an array. We learned the basic array methods, but is there one that we can use if we wanted to add a new element in an array of 10 into the 3rd index?
